## 🔧 Features

- **React** integrated with **Vite** for fast development.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for instant updates during development.

## 📦 Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for enhanced functionality:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, offering a faster alternative to Babel.
